        - [ ] A new function `export_spectrogram(data, path)` is available.
        - [ ] The function supports exporting to PNG and JPG formats.
        - [ ] Users can specify the image resolution (e.g., DPI).
        - [ ] The function raises an error if an invalid file path is provided.
        - [ ] Documentation for the new function is added to the user guide.
