## About SoundML Testing

We choose [librosa](https://librosa.org/) as the main reference implementation for the algorithms inside SoundML. Thus, the tests are based on results obtained from librosa runs on a few audio source files either found on [freesound.org](https://freesound.org/), [freemusicarchive.org](https://freemusicarchive.org) or generated by us using FFmpeg.

The Python script `generate_vectors.py` is used to generate a set of vectors directly from running librosa algorithms onto the audio files present in the `test/audio` directory. Once generated, these vectors are stored in the `test/vectors` directory and are used by `Alcotest` to compare the results of SoundML with the ones from librosa.
